This folder contains scripts that are used to generate the R package data from the raw data uploaded weekly by Gang Liu to the GitHub repository.  

The name "data-raw" comes from [R package conventions](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#sec-data-data-raw).

I don't know if we can actually do this like this in the package itself...?? I need to square this up still with the workflow but it helps for the purpose of separating code components.
