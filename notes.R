the caching was not set up properly according to the shiny docs

i know i have it kinda off now still tho
need to get the right key

# we bind the cache of the gauge plots with the key of the date because the 
function has no args or only is based on a big arg (like basemap)
#  i think we'll actually want to base it off of the data's date

we're now using the global function to assign and clear global to remove 

all the app text gets read in through HTML so can markup if wanted
